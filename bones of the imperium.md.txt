Bones of the Imperium


In the shadowed halls of grim Eternity,
Where echoes haunt and whispers weave,
The bones of the Imperium lie deep,
In sepulchres where the damned still grieve.


From ancient wars and sacred rites,
Their marrow cold with ancient blight,
The relics of a thousand fights,
In darkness bound, in endless night.


Upon the altar, bone and steel,
Where prayers are whispered, dark and real,
The sacred relics cold reveal
A history of wounds that never heal.


In the charnel pits where shadows loom,
Where xenos' screams and stench consume,
The skeletal remains, a silent tomb,
Bear witness to the ceaseless doom.


The bone-dust of the fallen great,
Their spectral forms, their ghostly fate,
Their sinew whispers through the gate
Of time and war’s relentless hate.


So heed the silence of the dead,
In every bone, a story’s said,
Of battles fought, of blood that's shed,
Of legions lost, of those who bled.


In this dark galaxy’s ceaseless roam,
The bones of warriors call us home,
To fight the shadows, to forever comb
The void for peace, or find our doom.
