Bones of the Imperium
---
In the shadowed halls of grim Eternity,<br>
Where echoes haunt and whispers weave,<br>
The bones of the Imperium lie deep,<br>
In sepulchres where the damned still grieve.<br>



From ancient wars and sacred rites,<br>
Their marrow cold with ancient blight,<br>
The relics of a thousand fights,<br>
In darkness bound, in endless night.<br>


Upon the altar, bone and steel,<br>
Where prayers are whispered, dark and real,<br>
The sacred relics cold reveal<br>
A history of wounds that never heal.<br>


In the charnel pits where shadows loom,<br>
Where xenos' screams and stench consume,<br>
The skeletal remains, a silent tomb,<br>
Bear witness to the ceaseless doom.<br>


The bone-dust of the fallen great,<br>
Their spectral forms, their ghostly fate,<br>
Their sinew whispers through the gate<br>
Of time and war’s relentless hate.<br>


So heed the silence of the dead,<br>
In every bone, a story’s said,<br>
Of battles fought, of blood that's shed,<br>
Of legions lost, of those who bled.<br>


In this dark galaxy’s ceaseless roam,<br>
The bones of warriors call us home,<br>
To fight the shadows, to forever comb<br>
The void for peace, or find our doom.<br>
