Salm on Bones

---

In the shadowed vaults where darkness lies, Amidst the shattered shields and weary cries, 

The bones of fallen heroes sing their tale, In the grim domain where hope turns frail.

Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, Silent sentinels of endless fight, T
hrough the ashes and the bloodied earth, Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.

In the ash-cloaked void where the stars burn bright, Where wars are waged in endless, 

brutal blight, The relics of our courage, stark and bare, Stand as testament to the souls laid bare.

Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, Silent sentinels of endless fight, 

Through the ashes and the bloodied earth, Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.

Each shattered bone, a saga carved in pain, A monument to those who never wane, 

Their names, etched in the silence of the dead, Guide the living through the darkened dread.

Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, Silent sentinels of endless fight, 

Through the ashes and the bloodied earth, Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.

In the void where the Emperor's light fades, Where hope is lost in war's relentless shades, 

Their bones remain, the relics of the fight, Shining in the dark like ancient night.

Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, Silent sentinels of endless fight, 

Through the ashes and the bloodied earth, Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.

So let us honor those whoâ€™ve passed away, In the grim, unending battle's fray, 

For in the bones of fallen we find grace, Their sacrifice, our undying trace.

Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, Silent sentinels of endless fight, 

Through the ashes and the bloodied earth, Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.
