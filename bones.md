Salm on Bones
---

In the shadowed vaults where darkness lies, <br>
Amidst the shattered shields and weary cries,<br>
The bones of fallen heroes sing their tale, <br>
In the grim domain where hope turns frail.<br>

---
Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, <br>
Silent sentinels of endless fight, <br>
Through the ashes and the bloodied earth, <br>
Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.<br>

---
In the ash-cloaked void where the stars burn bright, <br>
Where wars are waged in endless, <br>
brutal blight, The relics of our courage, stark and bare, <br>
Stand as testament to the souls laid bare.<br>

---
Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, <br>
Silent sentinels of endless fight, <br>
Through the ashes and the bloodied earth, <br>
Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.<br>

---
Each shattered bone, a saga carved in pain, <br>
A monument to those who never wane, <br>
Their names, etched in the silence of the dead, <br>
Guide the living through the darkened dread.<br>

---
Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, <br>
Silent sentinels of endless fight, <br>
Through the ashes and the bloodied earth,<br>
Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.<br>

---
In the void where the Emperor's light fades, <br>
Where hope is lost in war's relentless shades, <br>
Their bones remain, the relics of the fight, <br>
Shining in the dark like ancient night.<br>

---
Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, <br>
Silent sentinels of endless fight, <br>
Through the ashes and the bloodied earth, <br>
Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.<br>

---
So let us honor those whoâ€™ve passed away, <br>
In the grim, unending battle's fray, <br>
For in the bones of fallen we find grace, <br>
Their sacrifice, our undying trace.<br>

---
Chorus: Bones, bones, in the cold embrace of night, <br>
Silent sentinels of endless fight, <br>
Through the ashes and the bloodied earth, <br>
Rise the echoes of our ceaseless worth.<br>
